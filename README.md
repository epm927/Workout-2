### Workout 2

Welcome to Ethan Marzban's workout 2 GitHub repository! In this assignment, we will be:

* Creating Functions
* Testing Functions

The functions we created were:

* `minkowski()` (computes the Minkowski Distance between two points)
* `is_hex()` (determines whether a string is in valid Hexadecimal notation)
* `is_hex_alpha()` (an extension of `is_hex()` to include an alpha specification)
* `count_vowels()` (counts the number of vowels in a given string

Every function was tested, and the output of the master test file was produced (in the folder labeled `output`) Enjoy!
